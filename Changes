Version 1.2.1:

- bug fixes

Version 1.2:

- Distribution: optionally relies on FINDLIB Ocaml library managemenrt
  (command ocamlfind)

- API
  * New type system to distinguish mutable and immutable types.
    For instance, for mpz,
    o general type is 'a Mpz.tt,
    o explicit mutable version is type Mpz.t = Mpz.m Mpz.tt,
    o explicit functional version is type Mpzf.t = Mpz.f Mpz.tt

  * In Mpzf module, internal functions mpzf and mpz replaced with _mpzf and
    _mpz, same for Mpqf, Mpfrf.

  * In Gmp_random module, mpfr_urandom removed (removed in MPFR 3.0.0)

Version 1.1:

- API

  * Mpfrf added (functional interface to Mprf).
  * Random functions for Mpfr numbers in Gmp_random module.

- Distribution/Packaging

  * HTML Links to GMP/MPFR online documentation added in .mli files.
