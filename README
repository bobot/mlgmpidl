# released under LGPL license.

This package is an OCAML interface for GMP and MPFR libraries.

The interface is decomposed into 5 modules:
Mpz       : GMP multiprecision integers
Mpzf      : GMP multiprecision integers, functional version
	    (no side-effect on numbers)
Mpq       : GMP multiprecision rationals
Mpqf      : GMP multiprecision rationals, functional version
	    (no side-effect on numbers)
Mpf       : GMP multiprecision floating-point numbers
Gmp_random: GMP random numbers generation
Mpfr      : MPFR multiprecision floating-point numbers
Mpfrf	  : MPFR multiprecision floating-point numbers, functional version
	    (no side-effect on numbers)

Compared to the well-known MLGMP interface developped by D. Monniaux
(http://www.di.ens.fr/~monniaux/programmes.html.en), MLGMPIDL favours an
imperative interface to a functional interface (all functions are offered in an
imperative version, more efficient in term of memory allocation). Moreover, it
uses CamlIDL, which allows to design easily further OCaml/C interface that
needs GMP types, using "import mpz.idl" clauses. The APRON project exploits
this.

REQUIREMENTS
============
GMP library (tested with version 5.x.y and up)
MPFR library (requires version 3.x.y)
OCaml 3.0 or up (tested with 3.09)
Camlidl (tested with 1.05)
GNU sed, version 4.1 or up
FINDLIB (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html)

INSTALLATION
============

1. Library
----------

Set the file Makefile.config using the Makefile.config model to
your own setting.  You might also have to modify the Makefile for
executables

type 'make', and then 'make install'

The OCaml part of the library is named gmp.cma (.cmxa, .a).  The C
part of the library is named libgmp_caml.a (libgmp_caml_debug.a), or, with dynamic linking, dllgmp_caml.so.

'make install' installs not only .mli, .cmi, but also .idl files.

Be aware however that importing those .idl files from other .idl
files will probably request the application of SED editor with the
scripts sedscript_caml and sedscript_c (look at the Makefile).

2. Linking
------------

With FINDLIB, no problem at all.

gmp.cma requires bigarray.cma. 

Look at the rule for session.byte and session.opt executable in the Makefile
to see how to link against gmp.cma/gmp.cmxa.

3. Interpreter and toplevel
---------------------------

With dynamic linking, you can use ordinary runtime ocamlrun and toplevel.

You can play with [session.ml], and compile it with 'make session.byte',
'make session.opt'.

4. Documentation
----------------

The documentation (currently, just refers to GMP and MPFR doc) is generated
with ocamldoc.

'make mlgmpidl.pdf'
'make html' (put the HTML files in the html subdirectoy)

5. Miscellaneous
----------------

'make install', 'make uninstall',
'make clean' and 'make distclean' have the usual behaviour.
